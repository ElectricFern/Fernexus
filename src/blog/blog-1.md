# Cathathon 2024

Each year Catalyst.net runs a full day extravangza called Catathon.

At Catathon employees are involved in:
- running group activities
- joining in others activities
- working on projects solo or with others
- contributing to open source projects
- sharing knowledge through workshops
- and much more

This year I created this static site and decided to kick things off with an initial blog!

I will also be working on my Ardiuno project. More on that in the next blog!
